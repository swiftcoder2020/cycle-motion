# Technologies Utilised

## Development Tools

[GitHub](https://www.github.com/) :- this is a collaborative tool which consists of a community of developers and has been used to create the repository and store the coding of the project subsequent from being pushed via Git.

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) :- an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) editor utilised to create folders, files and code the website.

[Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) :- a form of versioning control by way of utilising the terminal within Gitpod to commit to Git, then subsequently push to GitHub.

[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) :- this is a client-side technology that helps to send emails.

[Google Chrome Developer tools](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) :- the feature within the browser was used to test both the code and the responsiveness of the website.

[Mozilla Firefox Developer tools](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) :- the feature within the browser was used to test both the code and the responsiveness of the website.

[paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) :- was used to produce images of resized screenshots into the website for the readme.md.

## Design

[Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com/) :- the software has been utilised whereby it is related to the creation of wireframes as part of the preparational work into the duration of the design process through the Cycle Motion milestone project.

<!-- not decided yet between Bootstrap and Materialize but most likely to be the latter -->
[Bootstrap v5](https://www.getbootstrap.com/)/[Materialize](https://www.materializecss.com) :- this is a CSS framework which is used to assist with making the design responsive whilst being complimentary with the styling of the website.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) :- these were used to import the typography of the website into the stylesheet file and is utilised on all webpages.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) :- these icons would be added for the purpose of 
aesthetic appeal and UX design.

[ezGIF](https://ezgif.com) :- this was used to create an animated gif file which in turn was converted to a favicon.

[favicon](https://www.favicon.cc/) :- the website was used to create a favicon using the animated gif derived from ezGIF.

# Project Bugs and Solutions



# Testing

As standard with any development into a website, the first step subsequent to the conclusion of the construction is to check using a variety of technical testing tools (and this time includes two additions of JSHint and PEP8) which are split into subsections:

## W3C Validator Tools

The basic methodology for checking into any form of errors commences by utilising the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) against all my HTML webpages of this project.

The next validation tool is to utilise the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) which checks into the CSS styling of the project's webpages.

## JSHint

[JSHint](https://www.jshint.com) is a tool that assists in the quality of JavaScript by detecting errors and potential problems within the code.

## PEP8

[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) is a website that provides the styling conventions or best practices into the Python code which will be used within this project.

## Responsive Tools

A website by the name of [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was utilised to give an indication into the responsiveness of how the project caters for the layout design within a range of devices.

## General Technical Testing



# Deployment

Given that the deployment of the previous second milestone project was based on GitHub Pages, which allows the hosting of static websites, the learning experience and skills of the subsequent module into Back-end Development have progressively transitioned whereby the language of Python will be adopted in this third milestone project therefore the hosting provider of Heroku is necessary as Python cannot be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Initial Deployment

The development into this third milestone project has utilised the IDE of [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io) which was subsequently pushed to the development community of [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and finally deployed using the recommended hosting provider of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). As a result of this, the following steps should be taken as specified below:

1. Create a file entitled as `requirements.txt` using the command of `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` within the terminal of GitPod.
2. Using the same GitPod terminal, create a `Procfile` via the command of `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.
3. Next, enter the command of either `git add.` or `git add -A` and then `git commit -m` the new requirements and Procfile files respectively before finally executing a `git push` to the GitHub repository.
4. Within the website of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), either Sign up or Log in where applicable.
5. Once you have signed up or logged in on Heroku, the creation of a new application is done through the click of the 'Create New App' button within your dashboard. Then choose a unique name and set the region that is closest to you e.g. Europe.
6. Within the dashboard of Heroku of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method", then select "GitHub" and finally click the "Connect to GitHub" button.
7. Search for your correct GitHub repository name that you have created and confirm the linking up through a click on the "Connect" button.
8. Return back to your Heroku dashboard and click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
9. Set the following config vars as:

| Key | Value |
| ----------|--------- |
| PORT | 5000 |
| IP | 0.0.0.0 |
| DEBUG | False |
| MONGO_URI | USER_MONGODB_URI |
| MONGO_DBNAME | USER_MONGODB_NAME |
| Secret_Key | USER_SECRET_KEY |

## Fork a Repository

Should you wish to create a duplicate copy of a repository, the following simple steps is to be taken:

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Within GitHub, direct yourself to [swiftcoder2020/cycle-motion](https://github.com/swiftcoder2020/cycle-motion)
3. Navigate to the top right corner and click "Fork"

## Clone a Respository

To clone a repository, the instructions are as follows:

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Fork the repository of swiftcoder2020/cycle-motion using the simple steps of [Fork a Repository](#fork-a-repository) as aforementioned in the previous section above.
3. Below the name of the repository and above the list of files, click "Code"
4. Choose if you want to clone using HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI, then click the copy button to the right
5. Open Git Bash
6. Change the directory to where you want your clone to go
7. Type "git clone" and then paste the URL you copied in step 4
8. Press Enter to generate your clone


## Generate a Local Clone

The following steps should be processed in order to 

1. Firstly, log in to GitHub
2. Again, below the name of the repository and above the list of files, click "Code"
3. Similar to point 4 of 'Clone a Repository', only this time you should clone the repository using HTTPS and click on the icon to copy the link.
4. Next, open Git Bash
5. Amend the current working directory to the new location, where you want the cloned directory to be.
6. Type `git clone` and then after, paste the copied URL from step 4
7. Press the Enter button and your local clone will be created.
